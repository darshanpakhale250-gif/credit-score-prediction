# Credit Score Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts customer credit scores based on various financial and behavioral features using machine learning models.  
It includes extensive data cleaning, transformation, encoding, visualization, and model training to predict whether a customer’s credit score is Poor, Standard, or Good.
